This is cl-fs-blog, a very simple, no-rdbms HTML-TEMPLATE-based common lisp blog system. Will eventually have RDF templates for the semantically-inclined (and probably RDFa in the for-human-consumption templates); at the moment it's pretty much nothing. 

To try it out, get HTML-TEMPLATE, copy data-example.lisp to data.lisp, copy templates-for-compilation-example.lisp to templates-for-compilation.lisp, and poke around. Function MAKE-STATIC is all you should really need of what currently exists.
